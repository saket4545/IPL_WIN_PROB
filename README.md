# IPL Win Predictor 🏏

Welcome to the **IPL Win Predictor**! This interactive web application leverages **Logistic Regression**, a machine learning model, to predict the probability of a team's win in an IPL match based on various match parameters such as the batting team, bowling team, target, current score, overs done, and wickets down.

### 🔮 **How It Works:**
The app uses a **Logistic Regression** model to predict the win probability of both the batting and bowling teams. Simply input the relevant match details, and the model will give you the winning probabilities for both teams.
